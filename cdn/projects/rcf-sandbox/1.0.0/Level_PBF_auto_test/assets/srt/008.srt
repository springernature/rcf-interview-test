Hi, my name is John, I'm British and I like reading books and comics.

00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:09,700
I want to tell you about my favourite comic character, Iron Man. 

3
00:00:10,257 --> 00:00:17,031
He's American, his real name is Tony Stark and he is an engineering genius and a millionaire.

00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:22,136
Iron Man is a member of a superhero team, called The Avengers. 

5
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,710
The team fights with criminals and terrorists. 

6
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:31,982
Morgan, Iron Man's only cousin, is not in the team, he is a villain.

00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:39,889
For me, Iron Man is the best superhero in the world, but my friends like Superman or the Hulk too.
